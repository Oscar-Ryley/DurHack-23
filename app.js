    Text1.innerText =  "Much like the cryogenesis chambers on my space ship, savings accounts are a great way of saving your assets for a later date, to use them at a better time! One example of savings accounts is an ISA. An ISA, or Individual Savings Account, is a tax-free way of saving money. While there are 4 main types of ISA's, the main two that are important to mention are cash ISA's, the most simple type, and stocks and shares ISA's. ";
    Title2.innerText =  "What is a Cash ISA?";
    Text2.innerText =  "Cash ISA's work by you putting in money into the account, and over time, either at a fixed rate or a changing one, it gaining interest. Interest is the money you gain passively for lending out this money. So, in the case of cash ISA's, you simply put the money in and earn more, tax free! However, this is typically at a fixed rate, and so does not factor in inflation, which in low interest accounts, or periods of high inflation, can serve to lessen your earning.";
    Title3.innerText =  "What is a Stocks and Shares ISA?";
    Text3.innerText =  "Stocks and shares ISA's are slightly riskier - in stocks and shares ISA's, you can instead put money into a range of investments - see the stocks on the ship for more information! This can serve to greatly increase your earnings if those stocks do well, but could also lead to losses in some cases - a stock and shares ISA can be a brilliant way to save money, but there is definitely risk at play. I was almost bankrupt before I earned enough to buy this spaceship! You have to prepare to both earn, and lose money.";
    Title4.innerText =  "Ordinary Savings Accounts";
    Text4.innerText =  "The most common of savings accounts is an ordinary savings account. This simply operates off of lower risk, lower reward. Simply save your money safely, and have lower returns. A lot like an astronaut in a cryogenesis chamber for a short time - less changes in time, but theres less risk of the machine malfunctioning.";

    Title1.innerText =  "The Truth about Large Amounts";
    Text1.innerText =  "When you haven't yet been in control of your own money, it's very easy to see sums of money such as £1000 as incredible amounts. But, when you get out into the financial world, a previously large sum of money such as £1k suddenly seems a lot smaller. Imagine the Earth. When living on it, it seems huge and all encompassing, whereas here, on this spaceship, it looks rather small. ";
    Title2.innerText =  "The Truth about Small Amounts";
    Text2.innerText =  "Oftentimes a lot of people overlook the power of small amounts of money - if done well, a couple of pounds becomes a good meal, transport or a way to brighten a day. While large amounts of money are often sensationalised online, on television and in videos as a way to increase engagement, it's important not to let this cloud your vision of your own finances, which often come down to the small budgeting!";
    Title3.innerText =  "How does this apply?";
    Text3.innerText =  "In truth, good budgeting is about balancing both the large costs and the small costs. While a majority of your purchases in life will be small, it's mostly about not making too many small purchases in case you need to make a large one. You will quickly learn that large sums of money don't go as far as you may have previously thought, but this is all a part of learning to budget!";
    Title4.innerText =  "Have a Go!";
    Text4.innerText =  "Over the next few weeks, try and track your spending. You'll see this is mostly small costs like school lunches and treats afterwards, but you may come across larger costs that you may not have noticed - see how much you spend on games, on hobbies, on travel. You may find places where you can save yourself some money, and maybe eventually you could save enough to buy a spaceship like mine.";

function changeTextThree() {
    MainTitle.innerText = "Stocks";
    Title1.innerText =  "What is a stock?";
    Text1.innerText =  "A stock is a representation of a share of ownership of a company. In other words, by buying stocks of a company, you buy percentages of the ownership of that company. As a result, the value of your stock is dependent on the value, or success of the company that it belongs to. The value of stock of a successful company, like my spaceship company, will be higher, as more people will want to own a part of it, and equally the value of a struggling company would be much cheaper! ";
    Title2.innerText =  "What are Dividends?";
    Text2.innerText =  "Some companies provide extra incentive to those wanting to invest in their company's stock, in the form of dividends. Dividends are a regular sum of money paid to shareholders (people who own the company's stock) out of the company's profit. This is a reward given to the shareholders for buying stocks in the company. Not all companies do this however, so it is an important thing to take note of when buying stock!";
    Title3.innerText =  "How do I get the most out of my stocks?";
    Text3.innerText =  "While noone can, with 100% certainty, predict how stocks will vary and how companies will perform, the general rule for getting as much as you can out of your stocks and investments is to buy promising companies' stocks when they are low and the company is performing poorly, and then selling them to other potential shareholders when they gain in value. As a result, for the same stock, you have made a large profit.";
    Title4.innerText =  "What are the risks?";
    Text4.innerText =  "Unfortunately, as much as there is great opportunity in buying stocks, there is also great risk. You might buy a stock, thinking its about to go up, just for it to shoot down further, causing a loss in your purchase, or over time you could end up losing a substantial amount of value by missing out on a peak in value at one point. Whenever dealing with stocks, it's important to recognise and account for these risks, and to not buy so much stock that it would harm you substantially if you lose out on them!";

function changeTextFour() {
    MainTitle.innerText = "Mortgages";
    Title1.innerText =  "What is a Mortgage?";
    Text1.innerText =  "A mortgage is an agreement between a bank and a person buying property, in which the bank lends money out at interest and owns the property, on the condition that the person buying owns the property as soon as the loan is repaid. In practice, this means that a bank buys a house for you, and then you repay it, but until it's repaid it is owned by the bank. I had to take a mortgage out with Atom Bank to buy this spaceship - luckily they made it really easy with loads of support and low interest rates!";
    Title2.innerText =  "Mortgage or Rent?";
    Text2.innerText =  "In terms of ownership and buying power, mortgages are a lot better than renting, but renting is often the only accessible route for people due to mortgages requiring a large deposit - something most people just dont have. If you are fortunate enough to have enough for this deposit, or have good enough credit score for a bank to loan you even more money, a mortgage may be preferable.";
    Title3.innerText =  "What happens when I pay off my mortgage?";
    Text3.innerText =  "When you manage to pay off your mortgage, the property that was the focus of the agreement is finally yours! I remember when I first got to fly my spaceship around, free from the clutches of rising interest rates! After you have finished paying, the agreement is fulfilled, and so the conveyance (the transfer of the ownership to the bank) is void, meaning you have full ownership. Congrats!";
    Title4.innerText =  "What if I'm a first time buyer?";
    Text4.innerText =  "While coming into the housing market as a first time buyer, it can be very intimidating, especially with such large sums of money being introduced - to the point where even at a young age, the prospect can seem impossible! Many young people even believe they'll never own a property in their lives according to recent surveys. Luckily, some banks eg. Atom Bank provide first time buyer schemes at reduced rates and with cashback schemes. I remember when I was a first time spaceship buyer… Good times.";
