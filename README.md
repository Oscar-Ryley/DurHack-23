## Durhack challenges we are aiming for

### Hackiest Hack
Can't promise overengineered, but the project will be on strings!

### Most Creative Use of Github
Creative use of Github is best exemplified when it is used properly. We seek to attain this by working collaboratively, 
presenting a (as I hope you will come to agree) helpful and descriptive README.md and by applying Github to an 
inherently creative idea.

### THG - Out of this World Storefront 
Basing our website in outer space - quite literally out of this world. By including interactive models that include information, 
users can add these models to a shopping basket they can use to "buy" the information, thus acting as a storefront.

### Atom Bank - Save for the Future
While the website may look like a storefront, interacting with each of the items on screen in the space station will provide
relevant and helpful financial information, fulfilling the educational aspect of this challenge. In order to appeal to the 
targeted and specified demographic, we will be including a continually running display of short-form content, in order to
maintain the attention of a generation of decreasing attention span. While this may seem like a distraction, it will keep 
their thoughts occupied and will also serve to increase the time spent by the children on the website. With the items in the 
shopping basket, the running total will represent an amount against a budget, with differering advice given for how much
has been added to the basket, eg budgeting advice if too much is spent.


### The Project
The main idea for the project is a website that will, when interacting with 3D models, teach children and young teenagers about
finance and methods of saving, general financial knowledge and building good habits, such as budgeting. The website will take 
place on a spaceship and be 'narrated' by a resident astronaut who has used the techniques taught in the information boxes to 
buy the spaceship that he is currently on. By clicking on each item, relevant information will be displayed about financial 
knowledge pertaining to the object, ie a model of the globe corresponding with the skewed scale at which children see money. 
We have mainly used html, bootstrap, css and javascript to achieve this.
At the bottom of our website, we have included a running total of funds that changes upon interacting with each of the pieces
of information, or more accurately, a second buttom next to the information prompts. This is to accommodate the "out of this
world" storefront part of the project, and also strengthen the effect of the financial advice - by taking into account the 
various lessons learned on the website, the users can watch the funds grow (or fall, on the stock market), reinforcing the
quality of the lessons and solidifying the concepts numerically. This immersion is further yet increased but limiting the 
usage, so while you can put money into savings, or learn more multiple times, you are limited to only one mortgage.
